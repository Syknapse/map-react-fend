## Acknowledgements

I found this article to be particularly helpful when dealing with the third party API requirement:
[How to Build a Wikipedia Search App with Javascript ES6](https://freshman.tech/wikipedia-javascript/)

To build this project from scratch I consulted endless pages of React docs, Stack Overflow answers, Slack and the rest of the FEND communication channels, and direct contact with mentors and students to solve problems, get inspiration, and keep advancing.
The following have been especially helpful to me:

Huge Thanks to Udacity, and Google. The amazing scholarship we were offered. The incredible staff, mentors, reviewers. The one of a kind group of enthusiastic fellow learners. And a special mention to my company Lola Market and my direct supervisors who not only gave me the opportunity to become a professional front-end developer, but also allowed me time to finish my nanodegree. It's been a wonderful ride so far.
